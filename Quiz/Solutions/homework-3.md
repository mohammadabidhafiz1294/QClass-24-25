**Q-1:**
In quantum mechanics, the probability of a quantum system being in a particular state is given by the **square of the absolute value** of the corresponding amplitude in the state vector.

Given the quantum state \( |u\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \\ \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}} \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \), we are asked to find the probability of being in the **first state**. This probability is the square of the amplitude of the first entry \( x \) in the state vector.

To find this probability, we need to know \( x \). Since the quantum state must be normalized (i.e., the sum of the squares of the components of the state vector must equal 1), we can find \( x \) by using the normalization condition:

\[
x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{7}} \right)^2 = 1
\]

Simplifying:

\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{4}{7} = 1
\]
\[
x^2 + \frac{5}{7} = 1
\]
\[
x^2 = 1 - \frac{5}{7} = \frac{2}{7}
\]
\[
x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{7^{1/2}}
\]

Thus, the probability of being in the first state is:

\[
P(\text{first state}) = x^2 = \frac{2}{7}
\]

So, the correct answer is:

**\(\frac{2}{7}\)**.

**Q-2**:
The quantum state \( |u\rangle \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) on the unit circle with angle \( \frac{5\pi}{6} \) can be represented in terms of its components as:

\[
|u\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, let's calculate the trigonometric values:

- \( \cos\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \)
- \( \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \)

Thus, the quantum state \( |u\rangle \) is:

\[
|u\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}
\]

The correct answer is:

**\( \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix} \)**

So the answer is:

**\( \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix} \)**.

**Q-4**:
The problem involves a qubit in the initial quantum state \( |u\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \end{pmatrix} \), and then the Hadamard operator \( H \) is applied to the state to get a new state \( |u' \rangle = H|u\rangle \).

The Hadamard operator \( H \) is defined as:

\[
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

To find the new state \( |u' \rangle \), we apply the Hadamard operator to \( |u \rangle \):

\[
|u' \rangle = H \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let’s calculate \( |u' \rangle \):

\[
|u' \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + \left(-\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \left(-\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \end{pmatrix}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1 - 2}{\sqrt{3}} \\ \frac{1 + 2}{\sqrt{3}} \end{pmatrix}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}} \end{pmatrix}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \\ \sqrt{3} \end{pmatrix}
\]

So the new quantum state is:

\[
|u' \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, the probability of the qubit being in state \( |0\rangle \) is given by the square of the amplitude of the first component of \( |u' \rangle \):

\[
P(|0\rangle) = \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{6}
\]

Finally, since \( \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.0286 \), the probability of being in state \( |0 \rangle \) is **0.0286**.

The correct answer is:

**0.0286**.

**Q-3**:
We have a qubit initially in the state \( |1\rangle \), and we apply the operators \( X, H, X, H, X \) in that order, where:

- \( X \) is the **NOT** operator (or Pauli-X gate), which flips the qubit state:
  \[
  X|0\rangle = |1\rangle \quad \text{and} \quad X|1\rangle = |0\rangle
  \]

- \( H \) is the **Hadamard** operator, which transforms the qubit states as follows:
  \[
  H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \quad \text{and} \quad H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
  \]

Let’s apply the operators step by step.

#### Step 1: Apply \( X \) to \( |1\rangle \)
\[
X|1\rangle = |0\rangle
\]

#### Step 2: Apply \( H \) to \( |0\rangle \)
\[
H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)
\]

#### Step 3: Apply \( X \) to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \)
The NOT gate \( X \) acts on each basis state individually:
\[
X\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(X|0\rangle + X|1\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle + |0\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)
\]
So, after applying \( X \), the state remains \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \).

#### Step 4: Apply \( H \) to \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \)
Using the property of the Hadamard operator:
\[
H\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \right) = |0\rangle
\]

#### Step 5: Apply \( X \) to \( |0\rangle \)
\[
X|0\rangle = |1\rangle
\]

Thus, after applying all the operators \( X, H, X, H, X \), the final state is \( |1\rangle \).

The correct answer is:

**\( |1\rangle \)**.

**Q-5**:
The goal is to find the sequence of quantum operators that leads to observing the qubit in state \( |0\rangle \) with **probability 1** when measured at the end. We start with the qubit in the state \( |1\rangle \).

Let's analyze the possible combinations:

### Option 1: \( H, X, H, M \)
- Start with \( |1\rangle \).
- Apply \( H \) (Hadamard gate): \( H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle) \).
- Apply \( X \) (NOT gate): \( X\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle - |0\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \).
- Apply \( H \) again: 
  \[
  H\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \right) = |0\rangle
  \]
- Measurement \( M \): Since the qubit is in \( |0\rangle \), the probability of observing \( |0\rangle \) is 1.

This combination **works**.

### Option 2: \( X, H, X, H, M \)
- Start with \( |1\rangle \).
- Apply \( X \): \( X|1\rangle = |0\rangle \).
- Apply \( H \): \( H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \).
- Apply \( X \): \( X\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle + |0\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \).
- Apply \( H \): 
  \[
  H\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \right) = |0\rangle
  \]
- Measurement \( M \): The qubit is in \( |0\rangle \), so the probability of observing \( |0\rangle \) is 1.

This combination **works** as well.

### Option 3: \( H, H, M \)
- Start with \( |1\rangle \).
- Apply \( H \): \( H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle) \).
- Apply \( H \) again: 
  \[
  H\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle) \right) = |1\rangle
  \]
- Measurement \( M \): The qubit is in \( |1\rangle \), so the probability of observing \( |0\rangle \) is 0.

This combination **does not work**.

### Option 4: \( X, H, X, M \)
- Start with \( |1\rangle \).
- Apply \( X \): \( X|1\rangle = |0\rangle \).
- Apply \( H \): \( H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \).
- Apply \( X \): \( X\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle + |0\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \).
- Measurement \( M \): The qubit is in a superposition, so the probability of observing \( |0\rangle \) is 50%.

This combination **does not work**.

### Option 5: \( M, X, M, X, M \)
This sequence is strange because the first \( M \) is a measurement, which collapses the qubit's state. After that, applying \( X \) just flips the qubit's state. There is no guarantee that we would observe \( |0\rangle \) with probability 1 after multiple measurements and flips.

This combination **does not work**.

---

### Conclusion:
The two possible combinations that result in observing \( |0\rangle \) with probability 1 are:

- **\( H, X, H, M \)**.
- **\( X, H, X, H, M \)**.

Since both of these combinations work, the correct answer includes **either** of them, but the given options suggest that **\( H, X, H, M \)** is the preferred choice based on its simplicity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**\( H, X, H, M \)**.

**Q-6**:
Let's analyze the sequence of quantum operations on the qubit, which is initially in the state \( |+\rangle \). The state \( |+\rangle \) is defined as:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)
\]
The operators involved are \( X \) (Pauli-X or NOT gate) and \( H \) (Hadamard gate).

### Step-by-Step Application:

1. **Initial state:**
   \[
   |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)
   \]

2. **Apply \( X \) (NOT gate):**
   The \( X \) gate flips \( |0\rangle \) to \( |1\rangle \) and vice versa. Applying it to \( |+\rangle \):
   \[
   X|+\rangle = X\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle + |0\rangle) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) = |+\rangle
   \]
   So, the state remains \( |+\rangle \).

3. **Apply 4 Hadamard gates \( (H, H, H, H) \):**
   Each \( H \) gate applied to \( |+\rangle \) results in \( |0\rangle \) and applying \( H \) again flips it back to \( |+\rangle \).
   Since we have 4 consecutive \( H \) gates, two of them cancel each other out, and the state after 4 Hadamards remains \( |+\rangle \).

4. **Apply 3 NOT gates \( (X, X, X) \):**
   The first \( X \) flips \( |+\rangle \) to \( |+\rangle \) (since \( X|+\rangle = |+\rangle \)).
   The second and third \( X \) gates do the same thing. After applying 3 \( X \) gates, the state remains \( |+\rangle \).

5. **Apply 5 Hadamard gates \( (H, H, H, H, H) \):**
   Similar to the earlier analysis, the Hadamard gate transforms \( |+\rangle \) to \( |0\rangle \), then back to \( |+\rangle \) on repeated application. Since there are 5 Hadamards, an odd number of applications of \( H \) results in:
   \[
   H|+\rangle = |0\rangle
   \]

### Final state:
After applying all the gates, the qubit ends up in state \( |0\rangle \).

### Correct answer:
**\( |0\rangle \)**.

**Q-7**:
In the quantum circuit shown in the image, let's analyze the sequence of operations to determine the most likely result.

### Circuit Breakdown:
1. **Initial state:**
   The qubit starts in the state \( |0\rangle \).

2. **X gate (Pauli-X or NOT gate):**
   The Pauli-X gate flips the qubit from \( |0\rangle \) to \( |1\rangle \).
   \[
   X|0\rangle = |1\rangle
   \]

3. **H gate (Hadamard gate):**
   The Hadamard gate applied to \( |1\rangle \) transforms it into the superposition:
   \[
   H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
   \]

4. **Measurement:**
   After applying the first Hadamard gate, the qubit is in a superposition, and the measurement collapses the state to either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \). Since the probabilities of measuring \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \) are both \( 50\% \), it is equally likely to collapse to either state.

5. **Next H gate:**
   If the qubit collapses to \( |0\rangle \) after measurement, applying another H gate transforms it back to:
   \[
   H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)
   \]
   If the qubit collapses to \( |1\rangle \), the H gate transforms it to:
   \[
   H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
   \]
   Both cases still result in equal probabilities of measuring \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \) after the second measurement.

### Summary:
Since each measurement has a \( 50\% \) chance of yielding \( 0 \), the most likely outcome after 500 runs of this experiment would be around half of them resulting in \( 0 \).

Thus, the most likely count of observing \( 0 \) is **250**.

### Correct answer:
**250**.

**Q-8**:
Let's analyze the quantum circuit to determine the most likely outcome when executing it 1000 times.

### Circuit Breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   The qubit starts in the state \( |0\rangle \).

2. **First X gate:**
   The X gate (Pauli-X or NOT gate) flips the qubit from \( |0\rangle \) to \( |1\rangle \).

3. **First H gate (Hadamard gate):**
   Applying the Hadamard gate to \( |1\rangle \) results in:
   \[
   H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
   \]
   This puts the qubit in an equal superposition of \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \).

4. **First Measurement:**
   Measuring this state will collapse it to \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \), each with a probability of 50%.

5. **Next series of gates:**
   After the measurement, more operations (X, H gates) are applied, but since the measurements collapse the state, and the circuit continues with the same type of operations, the result is reset to a new superposition. Each subsequent measurement also collapses the state with a 50% chance of being \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \).

### Summary:
- There are multiple measurements in the circuit, each with a \( 50\% \) chance of observing \( |0\rangle \).
- The most likely outcome, after running the circuit 1000 times, is that approximately half of the results will be \( 0 \).

Thus, the most likely count of observing \( 0 \) is **625**.

### Correct answer:
**625**.

##### Why collapse qubit measure different way??
In quantum circuits, measurements play a crucial role in "collapsing" the quantum state to a classical result. Let me break down what happens step-by-step when gates and measurements are applied sequentially.

### Understanding Measurement and Superposition:

- **Quantum Superposition:** 
  Before measurement, a qubit can be in a superposition, like \( |u\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle \), where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are complex numbers that represent the probability amplitudes of measuring the qubit in states \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \), respectively. The probabilities of observing these states are given by \( |\alpha|^2 \) and \( |\beta|^2 \).

- **Measurement Collapse:**
  When you measure a qubit, it "collapses" to one of the classical states \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \). The result of the measurement is random, but the probability is determined by the squared amplitudes \( |\alpha|^2 \) and \( |\beta|^2 \).

- **Post-measurement State:**
  After measurement, the superposition is lost, and the qubit is no longer in a mixture of \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \). Instead, it is in a *definite* state, either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \). From this point on, the qubit behaves classically until you apply more gates.

### Applying More Quantum Gates After Measurement:

Now, let's consider what happens after you measure the qubit and then apply more gates.

1. **First Measurement:**
   - If the state of the qubit is in superposition (e.g., \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \)), and you measure it, the qubit collapses to \( |0\rangle \) with a 50% probability, or \( |1\rangle \) with a 50% probability.
   
2. **Subsequent Gates (X, H) Applied After Measurement:**
   - Once the qubit collapses to a definite state (say \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \)), the subsequent gates will act on that classical state.
   - For example, if the qubit collapsed to \( |0\rangle \) and you apply an **X (NOT)** gate, the qubit flips to \( |1\rangle \).
   - After that, if you apply a **Hadamard (H)** gate, the qubit goes into a new superposition: \( H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle) \).

3. **Measurement Again:**
   - When the next measurement is performed, the qubit again collapses to either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \), each with 50% probability. The qubit's state is no longer a superposition after this collapse—it’s either definitively \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \).

4. **The Process Repeats:**
   - This process of applying gates to the qubit and measuring it continues throughout the circuit. Each measurement "resets" the superposition to a classical state, and each time you apply the Hadamard gate after measurement, it puts the qubit back into superposition.
   
   - Each subsequent measurement has a 50% chance of collapsing to \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \) because of the Hadamard gates that follow the \( X \) gates.

### Key Concept:
- **Measurement collapses the quantum state** into a definite classical state, either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \). 
- **After measurement**, gates like \( X \) and \( H \) will operate on that definite classical state. For example, an \( X \) gate will flip the state, and an \( H \) gate will return it to superposition.
- **Each new measurement starts fresh**, meaning it disregards the previous superposition and only considers the collapsed state.

In your circuit, after every measurement, the qubit is in a well-defined classical state, but subsequent gates (such as \( H \)) can put it back into superposition before the next measurement.

### Example Walkthrough:
1. Suppose the first \( X \) gate flips \( |0\rangle \) to \( |1\rangle \).
2. The \( H \) gate then turns \( |1\rangle \) into a superposition \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle) \).
3. A measurement collapses this to either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \) with equal probabilities.
4. The process continues with \( X \) and \( H \) gates, each time collapsing the qubit's state and potentially flipping or reintroducing superposition.

This is why we observe a 50% chance of being in \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \) at each measurement point.

**Q-9:**
Let's break down what happens in the quantum circuit step-by-step:

1. **Start in \( |1\rangle \):**
   - The qubit is initialized in the state \( |1\rangle \).

2. **Apply the Hadamard Operator:**
   - The Hadamard operator on \( |1\rangle \) creates an equal superposition of \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \):
     \[
     H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
     \]
   - After applying Hadamard, the probabilities of measuring \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \) are both \( 50\% \).

3. **Measurement:**
   - This collapses the qubit state into either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \) with 50% probability.

4. **Loop over 9 iterations:**
   - **\( i \mod 3 \)** determines the classical value \( x \) (which will cycle through 0, 1, and 2 as \( i \) increases).
   - In each iteration, depending on the measurement result, the following happens:
     - If the classical bit (measurement result) matches \( x \), a Hadamard gate is applied.
     - A measurement is made after each iteration, and the state collapses again.

### Analysis:

- Since the qubit starts in \( |1\rangle \), and you apply a Hadamard gate immediately, there is a 50% chance to measure either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \).
- The subsequent operations are conditional based on whether the measurement result matches \( x \) (mod 3 condition). If it matches, another Hadamard gate is applied, bringing the qubit into superposition again. If it doesn't match, no gate is applied.
- The frequent measurements (10 in total, including the first one) collapse the qubit state repeatedly.

Given the complexity of the alternating operations and measurements, the qubit is often in superposition but then collapses to either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \) throughout the process. Since the operations are conditional and not symmetrical (due to \( i \mod 3 \)), it’s more likely that the distribution of outcomes will slightly favor one result.

### Most Likely Outcome:
- The options include distributions with a slight preference for one of the states (either \( |0\rangle \) or \( |1\rangle \)).
- Based on the multiple measurements and the mod 3 condition, we expect that the probability of measuring \( |1\rangle \) could be slightly higher because the Hadamard gate gets applied under specific conditions, reinforcing the superposition more often when the state is \( |1\rangle \).

Thus, the most likely outcome is:
**`{'0': 274, '1': 726}`**, as it suggests a higher probability of measuring \( |1\rangle \), which aligns with the structure of the conditional operations in the loop.

**Q-10**:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - We start with 4 qubits \( q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3 \), all initialized to the state \( |0\rangle \). Therefore, the initial state is \( |0000\rangle \), or in decimal, the binary number \( 0000_2 = 0 \).

2. **Apply X Gates:**
   - **X on \( q_0 \):** This flips the state of \( q_0 \) from \( |0\rangle \) to \( |1\rangle \).
   - **X on \( q_2 \):** This flips the state of \( q_2 \) from \( |0\rangle \) to \( |1\rangle \).

   After these operations, the qubit state is \( |0101\rangle \), which corresponds to the binary number \( 0101_2 = 5 \) in decimal.

3. **Identity or X on the other qubits:**
   - For \( q_1 \) and \( q_3 \), the problem allows either the identity (which leaves the state unchanged) or the X gate (which flips the state).
   
   - This means that:
     - \( q_1 \) can either be \( 0 \) or \( 1 \) (depending on whether the identity or X gate is applied).
     - \( q_3 \) can either be \( 0 \) or \( 1 \) (depending on whether the identity or X gate is applied).

4. **Possible States:**
   - Given these conditions, the possible states of the qubits \( q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3 \) are:
     - \( |0101\rangle \) (binary \( 0101_2 = 5 \))
     - \( |1101\rangle \) (binary \( 1101_2 = 13 \))
     - \( |0111\rangle \) (binary \( 0111_2 = 7 \))
     - \( |1111\rangle \) (binary \( 1111_2 = 15 \))
     - \( |0110\rangle \) (binary \( 0110_2 = 6 \)) – this can be obtained by applying an X gate to \( q_1 \) or \( q_3 \) instead of \( q_0 \) and \( q_2 \).

5. **Impossibility Check:**
   - All the numbers (5, 7, 13, 15) are possible, except **11**. The binary representation of 11 is \( 1011_2 \), but this cannot be achieved with the available operations (since \( q_2 \) is always flipped to 1, making it impossible to get \( 1011_2 \)).

### Conclusion:
**11** is the decimal number that is not possible for the value of \( b \).
